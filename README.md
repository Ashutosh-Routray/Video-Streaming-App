# Simple Video Streaming App 

Implemented a Simple Video Streaming project using 

- Next.js
- NextAuth.js
- Prisma
- Tailwind CSS
- tRPC

## Create T3 App
This is a T3 Stack project bootstrapped with create-t3-app.

- What's next? How do I make an app with this?
I've tried to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with just the scaffolding we set up for you, and add additional things later when they become necessary.

If you are not familiar with the different technologies used in this project, please refer to the respective docs.

Feel free to look around
